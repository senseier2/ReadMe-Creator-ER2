## User Story

    To complete this project we were asked to fulfill the following user story: 

    GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

    WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository

    THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

    WHEN I enter my project title
    THEN this is displayed as the title of the README

    WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions

    THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
    WHEN I choose a license for my 
    application from a list of options

    THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under

    WHEN I enter my GitHub username

    THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile

    WHEN I enter my email address

    THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
    WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
    
    THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
